This container hosts up my personal website on port 80.

If you build and run this on your own machine you'll view the same website I have on https://chuck.findlayis.me served up by nginx on port 80 of the docker container.

I use this as a way to experiement with containers. If you access my website right now, you're going through a frontend that connects to kubernetes running this container.
